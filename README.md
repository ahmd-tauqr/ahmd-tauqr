- 👋 Hi, I’m @ahmd-tauqr
    
    Started as front end developer in 2016 with nothing but html and css,
    hoping to be the best with good old custom css until I discovered bootstrap.
    Later PHP changed my world when I could build backend web services, dabbled in wordpress theme and plugin development while I was at it.
    Got into JavaScript and never looked back.
